# Pediatric-Appendicitis_ML_Python_Version

Python implementation of the clinical machine learning project from Machine Learning & Pediatric Appendicitis(https://github.com/i6092467/pediatric-appendicitis-ml/tree/main). Predicts appendicitis complications using patient clinical data and ultrasound findings.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
### This repository contains a complete ML pipeline for:

Data preparation of clinical appendicitis datasets

Advanced feature engineering for medical variables

Comparative analysis of multiple machine learning models

Prediction of appendicitis complications (perforation, abscess formation)

## ðŸš€ Key Features

Clinical Data Processing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and medical terminology normalization

Class Imbalance Mitigation: Implements SMOTE for better minority class representation

Model Comparison: Evaluates Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting models

Interpretability: SHAP values and feature importance visualization

Reproducible Pipeline: End-to-end processing from raw data to predictions
